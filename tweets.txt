@Real203VT OMB. That is pricey for a new tiel and setup. I adopted my first tiel from a nursing home. The owner could not take care of the tiel anymore. It was $50 for the elderly tiel, his toys, and cage. I recommend to shop around. Probably a budget for future vet care

@VernediSnail Asking people to keep their hate to themselves is not fascism. It is called being a decent human being.\n\nI’m sick and tired of being told my kind “dirty up” the neighborhood. How is that ok? How is my requirement for respect equivalent to fascism
@ParrotTown The comment was deleted but I agree.\n\nSilence is free and it requires no effort
@VernediSnail Here I also disagree with being called a fascist for insisting on keeping your racist thoughts to yourself.\n\nShutting up doesn’t cost money, doesn’t incite fear, will not impact your career or relationship with community. I highly recommend it. \n\nPeople should shut up more often
@VernediSnail Saying your true self is a bigot person is not a justification for being a shitty human being. You can have biases but shut up.\n\nIn case of civility and be a decent human being, keep your garbage thoughts to yourself
@VernediSnail That is how we disagree philosophically. Bias and racism is a leak. If you allow it on your online account, it eventually burst out of your mouth in real life. Plug that hole. Never speak of it. Don’t even entertain it in your mind
@PetsInWild Mostly to shred from the inside. I put shredded paper or Nutriberries to keep her active
If someone actually tweets “everyone is racist” to justify your own racist behavior or support it, that is an automatic block IMHO. \n\nWelcome to Massachusetts. Go f- yourself. https://t.co/XPZbOq23t
